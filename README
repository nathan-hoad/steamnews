steamnews, a Python script for syndicating Steam game news in Atom format,
readable by all good news readers.

Feeds are available at http://getoffmalawn.com/steamnews/. Feel free to use it
for your own thing, if you want. See LICENSE file.

Written in Python 3 using the following libraries;

    - asyncio (asynchronous I/O...)
    - bbcode (rendering article bodies)
    - jinja2 (atom XML rendering)

Steam is really inconsistent in its article formats (HTML sometimes, bbcode
other times... probably more.) so it's kind of hard to make things look great
all the time. If you find any issues, let me know so I can take a look at them and try to normalise them.
